The assure package provides an addin for drafting testthat unit testing code using LLMs. Triggering the addin will open a corresponding test file and begin writing tests into it. The assure _test helper_ is familiar with testthat 3e as well as tidy style, and incorporates context from the rest of your R package to write concise and relevant tests.

## Installation

You can install assure like so:

``` r
pak::pak("simonpcouch/assure")
```

Then, ensure that you have an [`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`](https://console.anthropic.com/) environment variable set, and you're ready to go. If you'd like to use an LLM other than Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet—like OpenAI's ChatGPT—to power the test helper, see the `test_helper()` documentation.

The test helper is interfaced with the via the RStudio addin "assure: Test R code." For easiest access, we recommend registering the assure addin to a keyboard shortcut. **In RStudio**, navigate to `Tools > Modify Keyboard Shortcuts > Search "assure"`—we suggest `Ctrl+Alt+T` (or `Ctrl+Cmd+T` on macOS). The test helper is currently not available in Positron as Positron has yet to implement document `id`s that assure needs to toggle between source and test files.

Once those steps are completed, you're ready to use the assure addin with a keyboard shortcut.

## Example

To use the test helper, just trigger the addin (optionally selecting some code to only write tests for a certain portion of the file) and watch your testing code be written.
